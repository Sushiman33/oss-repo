  * Getstats:
  * Authors 9
  * Total Lines of Code 1223734 
  * First commit: Jun 5, 2020
  * First commit: Dec 4, 2020
  * Branches: Only showed that there was the main branch, not indication of other branches
  * Analysis: From the manual search to the Gitstats, there are some differences. The total number of lines are different but it could come down to how each script determined the total number of lines. The number of contributers from the manuel search only showed 6 while the Gitstats said there were 9 authors which one included a bot. There is some difference between the two but there seems to have been a grand restructuring at some point that changed the number of people associated to 6. That can be seen in the gource where a giant cluster is removed at some point. The commit dates for both also line up but this is much more restructed as to how to determine so they were almost guatranteed to show up the same. On Gitstats, it did not have any indicator of any branch other than main; a maunual search showed that the only active branch was main but there were 5 stale branchs. This may be how Gitstats was meant to gather data
