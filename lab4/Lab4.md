3.Why it is important to choose a LICENSE?:
It is important to choose a license because it defines all the aspects of how it can be used and who can use it if at all. There are licesnes that only allow for private use and others that allow for the code to be used anywhere. The license also defines if people can modify the code at all and all of the conditions that come along with doing that as well as defining if it can be used for profit.

4.Why is it important that you SHOULDN'T use a project that doesn't have an explicit license?
When someone uses a project that doesn't have an explicit license, they should be aware that the licesnce can be changed at any time to either an open source licesnse or some other proprietary licesnse which could justify legal actions for use of the code. The licesne chosen could also be incompatible with current liceses that are being used by the project. In this scenario, a lot of code will have to be rewritten in order to correct the issue of conflicting licenses which may be very long if it's well into development and how much depends on the previously unlicensed code.
