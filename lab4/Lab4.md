3.It is important to choose a license because it defines all the aspects of how it can be used and who can use it if at all. There are licesnes that only allow for private use and others that allow for the code to be used anywhere. The license also defines if people can modify the code at all and all of the conditions that come along with doing that as well as defining if it can be used for profit.

4.When someone uses a project that doesn't have an explicit license, they should be aware that the licesnce can be changed at any time to either an open source licesnse or some other proprietary licesnse which could justify legal actions for use of the code. The license chosen could also be incompatible with current liceses that are being used by the project. In this scenario, a lot of code will have to be rewritten in order to correct the issue of conflicting licenses which may be very long if it's well into development and how much depends on the previously unlicensed code.

5.The article claims Gopher had many reasons for its downfall including but not limited too not being in the spotlight, not implementing hypertext as well as HTML, charging for .com, and forking itself to death. I agree with the author on many of his points especially when it comes to the mental/psychological aspect of how we see things. WWW saw more mainstream use when search engines like internet explorer just defaulted to things like WWW while Gopher was stil available. The other points made about the open source aspect where Gopher did not have the same support as WWW which made it clear that Gohper was not going to last in the long term, especially with all of Gopher's forks not ever contributing back to Gopher.

6.Linux uses the GPL v2 license since it prevents sublicenses which means that modifiers to Linux must also use an open source License. This makes a lot of sense for Linux since they were always een as an alternative to Windows and MacOS and is perhaps the most notable and important projects for open source in general.
